### Dev Log — Entry 0001
**Date:** Arbitrum block: 366495858  
**Mood:** Hungry — was dead to the market, now back to drain it.  
**Market Note:** ETH hit $4,080.

### 🧠 What We Tried
- Extracting value from live market signals.
- Observing block patterns, searching for weak prey.
- Testing edge cases against Arbitrum's sequencer flow.

### 🚫 Failures
- Could not extract value due to centralized sequencer constraints.
- Came to the uncomfortable conclusion that this is the leading problem on rollups.
- Realized building here inevitably contributes to the mass problem of transaction spam.
- Accepting that participating in this “dark forest” means adding to it —  
  but isn’t MEV already there?
- Wondering: in this unfair game, what’s 5k–10k tx/sec really worth?

### 💡 Solutions
- Shift focus from direct chain execution to off-chain/repo-driven intelligence.
- Decouple market scanning from raw transaction flooding.
- Build for the dark forest — but choose our shadows wisely.

### 🪦 Revenant's Thoughts
> “All is fair in MEV and war. The forest doesn’t care if you’re hunter or prey — only that you’re fast.”

### 🎯 Next Steps
- Migrate scanning logic into the repo.
- Architect an execution layer that minimizes noise but strikes with precision.
